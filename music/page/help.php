                    <li> Disable Plug-ins and Extensions If you have any extensions or plug-ins enabled on your browser, please temporarily disable them and see if that helps. Often, an extension can block Music from working properly. </li>
                    <li>Try another browser If another browser (such as Google Chrome or Firefox) is uploading successfully, it may mean that this is a local issue - specific to your preferred browser.
                        If that is the case, try to clear your browser's cache and see if it works otherwise write mail to us at <b>help@music.xyz.com</b>. </li>
                    <li>Secure your internet connection Sometimes, upload interruptions can be blamed on a weak or spotty internet connection. If you're having difficulties we recommend using a cable connection rather than WiFi, particularly for larger files, because even a short WiFi connection timeout can interrupt the upload.</li>
